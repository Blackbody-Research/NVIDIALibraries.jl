# NVIDIALibraries.jl
NVIDIALibraries.jl was designed to allow full low level access by providing wrapper functions to the CUDA Toolkit libraries.

This package is a Julia library written for Julia 1.0 and onwards.

## What does full low level access mean?
NVIDIALibraries.jl defines C definitions and functions as they would appear in a C project.

## Which NVIDIA libraries are currently supported?
- CUDA library (NVIDIALibraries.CUDA)
- CUDA Runtime library (NVIDIALibraries.CUDARuntime)
- CUBLAS library (NVIDIALibraries.CUBLAS)

## How do I add this Julia package?
Enter the Pkg REPL-mode from the Julia REPL by using the key `]`.

Now add the Julia package by using the `add` command:
```
(v1.0) pkg> add https://github.com/Blackbody-Research/NVIDIALibraries.jl
```

## How are CUDA device arrays managed?
The `CUDAArray` datatype uses the CUDA Runtime library to allocate and free GPU device memory.

CUDAArrays can be constructed with initial values by passing a Julia array to `cuda_allocate(::Array)`.

In addition, CUDAArrays can be explicitly freed by calling `deallocate!(::CUDAArray)`.

## How do I load a CUDA kernel from a file?
Use `cuModuleLoad()` to load kernel by filename.
```julia
example_module = cuModuleLoad("example.ptx")
```

Alternatively, you can use the CUDA JIT linker to compile a PTX file into a cubin format.
```julia
jit_options = [CU_JIT_TARGET, CU_JIT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL]
jit_option_values = [CU_TARGET_COMPUTE_70, Cuint(4)]
jit_link_state = cuLinkCreate(2, jit_options, jit_option_values)
cuLinkAddFile(jit_link_state, CU_JIT_INPUT_PTX, "example.ptx")
cubin_array = cuLinkComplete(jit_link_state)

# cleanup CUDA JIT linker
result = cuLinkDestroy(jit_link_state)
@assert (result == CUDA_SUCCESS) ("cuLinkDestroy() error: " * cuGetErrorString(result))
```

Then, load the kernel from the new cubin image as a CUDA module.
```julia
example_module = cuModuleLoadData(Base.unsafe_convert(Ptr{Nothing}, cubin_array))
```

## What should I do if I want to update NVIDIALibraries.jl?
The `update` command in Pkg REPL-mode can be used to add recent commits made to NVIDIALibraries.jl:
```julia
(v1.0) pkg> update NVIDIALibraries
```
